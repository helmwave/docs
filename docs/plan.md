### planfile

Planfile is a main yaml document. It contains information about all your planned resources.
Planfile is a computed `helmwave.yml` file.

by default, planfile is stored in `.helmwave/planfile`


### graph.md

graph.md is a markdown file. It contains visualisation for graph dependencies.

You can open this file with your favorite IDE and render image with [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid). 

### manifest

Manifest is a directory where you can find all templated kubernetes resources.

by default is stored in `.helmwave/manifest/<uniqname>.yml`

You can do whatever you want with the manifests in this directory.

**For example,**

- You can apply that manifests directly like that: `kubectl apply -f .helmwave/manifest`
- You can lint manifests [:material-duck: example](../ci/?h=ci#kube-linter-and-helmwave)

### values

Values is a directory where you can find rendered values files of your releases.
To find the values for your releases you can use next pattern: `.helmwave/values/<uniqname>/<hash>.yml`


### charts

Charts is a directory where helmwave can store downloaded charts for all your releases. 
It's not required but very useful when you want to use helmwave with DMZ cases.
