# ðŸ”Œ IDE supports

Currently, we don't have any plugins for popular IDEs. You can help us with it ðŸ©µ.

We can suggest you to use json schema for autocomplete and validate `helmwave.yml` in your IDE.

You can [generate schema](../cli/#schema) with cli command `helmwave schema` and use it in your IDE.

```shell
helmwave schema > helmwave.schema.json
```

Or you can get it from [:simple-github: github](https://github.com/helmwave/helmwave/releases/download/v0.27.3/schema.json)

```shell
wget -L https://github.com/helmwave/helmwave/releases/download/v0.27.3/schema.json -o helmwave.schema.json
```
