# ðŸ”Ž Monitors

Monitors run custom releases validations and can rollback releases.

### Monitors flow

    end
```

- Each monitor starts when its all dependant releases succeeded
- Each monitor runs its iterations every `iterval` with `iteration_timeout`
- Consecutive successful iterations are counted towards `success_threshold`
- Consecutive failed iterations are counted towards `failure_threshold`
- After all monitors exited dependant releases do actions for their failed monitors
