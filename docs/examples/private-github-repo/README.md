**Suppose the `helmwave.yml.tpl` looks like**


```yaml
{% include "helmwave.yml" %}
```


This command will render `helmwave.yml.tpl` to `helmwave.yml`

```bash
$ export NS=stage
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=my-secret-token
$ helmwave yml
[ðŸ™ƒ aka INFO]: ðŸ“„ YML is ready!
        build plan with next command: helmwave build -f helmwave.yml
```

Once applied, your `helmwave.yml` will look like

```yaml
{% include "helmwave.yml" %}
```
