# ðŸ“„ Templating

Helmwave uses [Go templates](https://godoc.org/text/template) for templating.

Helmwave supports all built-in functions, [Sprig library](https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/sprig), and several
advanced functions:

- `toYaml` marshals a map into a string
- `fromYaml` reads a golang string and generates a map
- `readFile` get file as string
- `hasKey` get true if field is exists
- `get` (Sprig's original `get` is available as `sprigGet`)
- `setValueAtPath` PATH NEW_VALUE traverses a golang map, replaces the value at the PATH with NEW_VALUE
- `requiredEnv` The requiredEnv function allows you to declare a particular environment variable as required for
  template rendering. If the environment variable is unset or empty, the template rendering will fail with an error
  message.
