🌊 Helmwave is **[helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/)-native** tool for deploy your :simple-helm: helm Charts.

## 🚀 Features

> We focus on speed execution, tiny size, pretty debugging.

With 🌊 helmwave, you will become a superhero:

- Deploy multiple environments by one step
- Separate values for environments
- Common values for apps
- Keep a directory of chart value files
- Maintain changes in version control
- Template values
- Manage deploy behavior (`pending_release_strategy`, `depends_on`, `allow_failure`)
- Live tracking :simple-kubernetes: kubernetes resources with [kubedog](https://github.com/werf/kubedog)
- Fetch data from external datasource like vault, aws ssm
- ... and much more!


🌊 Helmwave was inspired by docker-compose, :material-terraform: terraform and helmfile.
