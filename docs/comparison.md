## Why not bare Helm?

### Managing multiple environments

Imagine you have multiple environments for same release (e.g. dev, stage, production, etc.). You likely have different settings.

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    You will likely have bunch of bash scripts that run helm with different values files. It is quite hard to support and improve.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Set up `helmwave.yml.tpl` to include different values for different environments.

Check out [:material-duck: the example](../examples/single-app-multi-envs)

### Passing generated values

For example, you need to pass docker image tag.

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    Either you template values file (e.g. with ansible/jinja2 or any other templater) or you pass every individual value via `--set`.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Every values file are templated via `sprig` or `gomplate` which allows you to generate any values even with external commands.

Check out [:material-duck: the example](../examples/pass-git-tag)

### Install multiple releases

Imagine you need to deploy more than 1 release (e.g. deploy 10+ microservices to dynamic feature environment).

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    Either deploy releases one-by-one or create an umbrella chart (we think it is bad pattern).

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    All releases are deployed in parallel with a dependency mechanism.

Check out [:material-duck: the example](../examples/umbrella-evil)

### Managing dependencies between releases

Imagine you need to deploy some DBMS and an app that uses it. While DBMS is provisioning (or scheduling) your app already starts failing probes. It may lead to failing app release.

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    Manually deploy releases one-by-one.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Use `depends_on` to set up explicit dependencies between releases.

### Release stuck in pending state

If your CI for some reason killed helm process your next `helm upgrade` will fail because release is in `pending-upgrade` state.

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    You need to either do `helm rollback` (doesn't work for `pending-install`) or `helm delete` (destructive in production) and try upgrade one more time.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Use `pending_release_strategy` to automatically do rollbacks or delete before upgrade if required.

### Live-tracking release

=== ":simple-helm: helm"
    You can enable debug logs which will provide you logs of what helm does.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Use [kubedog](https://github.com/werf/kubedog) to show status progress.

Check out [:material-duck: the example](../examples/kubedog)

## Why not [Helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/helmfile/helmfile)?

We don't consider helmwave as a helmfile killer. Helmfile is an awesome project that really inspired us to implement the same in a bit different way with some other features. Probably there would be no helmwave if there was no helmfile.

### Helm execution

=== "helmfile"
    Helmfile runs `helm` via `os.Exec`. It means that:

    - You need `helm` binary as well as a lot of other dependencies (e.g. libc). Helmfile's official docker image requires for around 300MB.
    - Helmfile collects, parses and outputs `helm` stdout/stderr. Any helm backward incompatibility (even occasional) may be a big pain in the ass.
    - `os.Exec` is not the fastest way to run helm. If 10ns of overhead does really matter to you.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Helmwave runs `helm` as an internal bundled library. It means that:

    - Helmwave already contains builtin specific (we try to keep it up to date) `helm` version.
    - There are no helmwave dependencies at all - it can be completely static binary. Official docker image requires for around 30MB. And it can run both in musl and glibc environments.
    - We constantly check out new `helm` features and try to enhance them in helmwave.


### Live-tracking release

=== "helmfile"
    Only helm progress is available although there is [a discussion about kubedog integration](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/discussions/660).

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Use [kubedog](https://github.com/werf/kubedog) to show status progress.

Check out [:material-duck: the example](../examples/kubedog)

### Release stuck in pending state

If your CI for some reason killed helm process your next `helm upgrade` will fail because release is in `pending-upgrade` state.

=== "helmfile"
    The same as for helm

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Use `pending_release_strategy` to automatically do rollbacks or delete before upgrade if required.

### Templating engine

By templating engine we understand collection of builtin functions for default golang templates.

=== "helmfile"
    Helmfile only supports `sprig` as a template engine.

=== "ðŸŒŠ helmwave"
    Every values file can be templated via `sprig` or `gomplate` (or even non-templated at all). Gomplate is an awesome huge engine that has a lot of features.
